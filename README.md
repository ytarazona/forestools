# forestools

**forestools** is a Python package that was created to provide a variety of tools and algorithms for processing and analyzing Remote Sensing for Earth Observations, especially for monitoring forest disturbance. **The PVts-$\beta$ approach**, a non-seasonal detection approach, is implemented in this package and is capable of reading matrix and raster data.

# Funding

The development of this package was funded by [American Program in GIS and Remote Sensing (APROGIS)](https://www.apgis-rs.com/). ARROGIS was established in 2018 as a leading scientific institution and pioneer in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). APROGIS promotes the use of state-of-the-art space technology and earth observation for the sustainable development of states. It is an institution capable of generating new knowledge through publications in the highest impact journals in the field of Remote Sensing.
