# forestools

*forestools** is a Python package that was created to provide tools for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover, especially detecting deforestation. The [**PVts-Beta**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326) approach, a non-seasonal detection approach (time-series-based), is implemented in this package.

This repository is part of the paper "Mapping deforestation using fractions indices and the PVts-beta approach" submitted to [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8859).

# Funding

The development of this package was funded by [American Program in GIS and Remote Sensing (APROGIS)](https://www.apgis-rs.com/). ARROGIS was <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytarazona/ForesToolboxRS/master/figures/logo_aprogis.png" align="right" width = 10%/> established in 2018 as a leading scientific institution and pioneer in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). APROGIS promotes the use of state-of-the-art space technology and earth observation for the sustainable development of states. It is an institution capable of generating new knowledge through publications in the highest impact journals in the field of Remote Sensing.
