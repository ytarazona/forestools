# forestools

**forestools** is a Python package that was created to provide tools for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover, especially detecting deforestation. The [**PVts-Beta**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326) approach, a non-seasonal detection approach (time-series-based), is implemented in this package.
